# Frontend Masters - Website from Scratch with Kevin Powell

These files are the step-by-step progress through both parts one and two of [my course on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/build-a-website/).

The number corresponds to the section of the course, so `part-1/04-start` would be the code at the start of _Section 4: The big picture_, for example.

I only provide starting points, because `05-start` would be the same as the ending of section 4.

I hope that you enjoy the course!
